# RentNowPk — Full Platform Flow

Implementation map for current App Router segments: [routes.md](./routes.md).

---

## 1. Public Layer

- Landing page with search by city, current location, car type, and other filters
- SEO dynamic pages auto-generated per keyword, city, town, and vehicle name
- Each vendor has a public business profile page (fleet, ratings, city coverage — no contact details)
- Each vehicle has its own optimized listing page

---

## 2. Customer Journey

### 2.1 Auth Flow

- Customer visits site and searches or browses listings
- Clicks "Request a Booking" on a vehicle page (opens as overlay on same page)
- System checks login status
  - If logged in → proceed to booking form
  - If not logged in → show login / signup prompt
    - On signup: auto-verify (no Supabase email verification step for customers)
    - After signup, all previously filled booking details are retained — customer does not re-fill

### 2.2 Booking Request Form (overlay on vehicle page)

Fields:
- Pickup location (free text with Google Places autocomplete — free tier)
- Drop-off location (free text with Google Places autocomplete)
- From date and time
- To date and time
- Full name (auto-filled from profile after first booking)
- CNIC (auto-filled from profile after first booking, mandatory first time, saved for future)
- Drive type: With Driver or Self Drive (only options the vendor enabled for that car)
- Optional note

System actions on submission:
- Distance from pickup to drop-off is calculated in the backend
- A one-on-one chat thread is opened between customer and vendor
- Booking request appears in that chat thread with all details including calculated distance
- Vehicle calendar does not block dates yet at this stage

### 2.3 Waiting State

- Customer sees the booking request as "Pending" in their bookings page
- Customer can cancel the request before vendor accepts (no reason required at this stage)
- Multiple customers can request the same car for overlapping dates — vendor decides which to accept

### 2.4 After Vendor Accepts

- Customer is notified in chat and via push and in-app notification
- Vehicle dates are blocked on the calendar
- Booking moves to "Confirmed" state
- Customer can cancel up to 24 hours before pickup with a reason
- After booking is confirmed, contact details (phone number) are shared via booking summary email to both parties
- Google Maps location sharing is enabled in the chat thread after confirmation

### 2.5 Payment

- No in-platform payment for now
- Payment happens off-platform after the ride (cash or bank transfer)
- Platform will add Stripe, JazzCash, and EasyPaisa in a future release

### 2.6 Review

- After the ride, vendor can send a review link from the chat thread
- Customer can also leave a review independently from their booking history
- Review link never expires and stays the same URL for security
- Only customers with a confirmed and completed booking can leave a review
- One review per booking per customer
- 30-day window per vehicle between reviews from the same customer
- Review opens on a dedicated page (new tab)

---

## 3. Vendor Journey

### 3.1 Signup

- Vendor signs up with: Business Name, Email, WhatsApp Phone Number, Password
- Supabase sends email verification (standard flow)
- After verification, vendor is redirected to `/vendor/vehicles/add`
- A top banner prompts vendor to submit verification docs before vehicles go live

### 3.2 Verification (KYC)

Vendor submits:
1. CNIC number
2. Front and back CNIC images
3. Own photo (selfie)

- Vehicles are listed and visible in the vendor dashboard but hidden from the public until admin approves
- Admin approves or rejects with a short note for resubmission
- Once approved, all listed vehicles go live simultaneously (vendor-level verification, not per vehicle)
- Vendor notified via email and in-app notification on approval or rejection

### 3.3 Vehicle Listing

Each vehicle includes:
- Up to 5 images (first image is cover by default, vendor can change cover manually)
- Vehicle name, make, model, year
- City/cities where the vehicle is available for pickup (vendor can list in multiple cities; auto-fills city for subsequent listings)
- Drive type: With Driver, Self Drive, or both (vendor enables each separately and sets price for each)
- Price per day and per month for each enabled drive type
- Vehicle can be activated or deactivated at any time (deactivated vehicles hidden from site, existing confirmed bookings unaffected)

### 3.4 Availability and Calendar

- Vendor marks specific dates as unavailable directly on a calendar UI
- Vehicle still shows on the site on unavailable dates but booking requests for those dates are blocked
- Once a booking is confirmed, those dates are auto-blocked on the calendar
- If two customers request the same car for overlapping dates, vendor accepts one and the other sees those dates blocked going forward

### 3.5 Receiving and Managing Bookings

- New booking requests appear in the vendor's bookings page and in the one-on-one chat thread
- Vendor can chat with the customer, then Accept or Reject
  - Accept → dates auto-blocked, customer notified
  - Reject → customer notified with a message in chat
- If vendor tries to accept a booking that was already accepted by another vendor (or duplicate scenario), system shows a conflict message and creates a new booking for the customer to confirm

### 3.6 "Send Offer" Button (in chat)

- Both vendor and customer see a "Send Offer" button in the chat thread
- Clicking opens a popup where vendor can:
  - Select a different vehicle from their fleet
  - Set custom dates, times, and price
  - Add a note
- Customer can also initiate via the same button to request a different vehicle from that vendor's fleet (popup shows only the vendor's available vehicles for the originally requested dates)
- Customer cannot change the vendor in this flow — only the vehicle or dates

### 3.7 Review System (Vendor Side)

- Vendor can send a review link to the customer from the chat thread
- Vendor also receives a review rating from the customer that is displayed publicly on their profile and all their vehicle pages
- Vendor can reply to a customer review (50-word limit)
- Auto-review prompt is sent 1 day after the booking end date via chat and notification
